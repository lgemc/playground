# Internal navigation

Playground app try to be as much as a operative system as it can.

So, i want to run apps individually and then switch between them, like it were the operative system itself, per now just a floating single point like
ios menu, after click on this point other option appear: show open apps where all apps running are shown and i can change between them, or close them.
