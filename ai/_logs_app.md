# Logs app

I want to have a logs app which allows me to see what is happening with app logs, to see and search by:

1. App name
2. Severity

and i also want to see metadata when clicking over the log with a side bar which comes from the right and is occluded when clicking outside. it must not occupy more than 60% of the screen and background must have some opacity while that, but not hidden. Add a close button if you thing we need it
