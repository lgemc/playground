# playground project

A project to contain other applications inside :v (based on flutter, file management and sqlite)

With de advent of llms now create and ship applications is easier than ever, not only for others but for personal use as well.

But there is a problem: ship an application is pretty complex, and if you 
will need various applications to be accepted and published at the playstore or apple store it will make more difficult to use the full potential of llm application generation. 

That is why this application is created, it will:

- Provide a simple ui/ux to access sub applications
- As possible it must be file oriented, data will be stored mostly as files, if not it will be stored in sqlite.
- It must allow to share the information across many devices, sharing created files and sqlite (yep, the full database). this is future work.
- The interface and architecture must be pretty similar to how the mobile 
operative systems works, in both the appearance and functionality.
